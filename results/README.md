The jury had a really hard time to pick 5 submissions out of the excellent solutions we received.
At the final round on [March 26th in Wolfsburg](https://gi.de/meldung/team-der-tu-braunschweig-gewinnt-informaticup-der-gesellschaft-fuer-informatik/), the finalist all gave a presentation of their approach.
All presentations have been :sparkles:, but we had to come up with a ranking so here we go:
